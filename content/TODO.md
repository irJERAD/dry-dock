# TODO

## Problems  

- TODO shows up in the top menu bar on the home page but not on pages further down the stream
- I have not gotten up new content folders
  - I need my SILO folder and subfolders to produce blog like list pages with the individual post contained within each folder
- The pop up at the beginning of visiting the website is annoying
  - Assess what your original goal / intention was behind it and consider:
    - Can I just remove it quickly now for efficiency
    - Do I need to find some place else to achieve the goal they set out to accomplish?

## Questions?
- What am I doing in writing this out?
  - First goal is clearly selfish: I wish to mock out a methodology for me to apply to my life and actualize previously a mocked up dream future
  - Secondly, am I doing this for others IRL?
    - If so, am I trying to:
      - Do I want to Convince others to use or why they should use SILO (a good way to narrate the material and organize it argumentatively of course but is this the intention? does that matter?)
      - Do I want to clearly define SILO and outline what it is theoretically with practical examples with informational intent
      - __Is this meant to add accountability:__ Do I mean this as a log of my own application of the process thus further ingraining the practice into my daily life by adding accountability

- Create SILO head of library page
    - Try following poem in layout and poems in content
- Reduce clutter of the TODO page header

### Manifesto
- Write Manifesto
- Draft Manifesto
- Publish Manifesto
- Create place for it within the SILO web space

### The Way
"How you have applied SILO"
- consider situations in which SILO showed successful even without you
  - what about hypothetical situations common enough to find resonance and realistic enough to be taken seriously
- Brain storm a handful of times you have already practiced these principles
  - ideal, that do a good job representing the outcomes you are looking for and highlight particular facets of SILO

### The Why
- __Meditate and take notes on the manifesto__
  - What does it mean in its own right?
  - What does it mean to you?
  - What does it mean to other who may want to apply SILO?
- __Ideas for topics:__
  - Why SILO is good for other / the world / mostly those you love
    - Why being selfish (with those you love or not) is good for those you care about
    - How you should be selfish
      - You should not be taking what you wish with no expectation of consequences
      - What ideal SILO selfishness is and looks like with examples as well as conceptually



### The Will
- write down the top areas that you can apply SILO to your life right now
  - Select the ones that make the most sense for this narrative and have a high likely hood of transferring from the will to the way

## Platform
Where will this work with SILO exist?
- Currently I am placing it on The Dry Dock purely out of the easiest and quickest way to get it published
  - Though it does have serious merritt for living here
- Do I want this directly on my personal site?
  - Do I get value from showing this off?
  - How will this affect the way I portray my work?
    - I will have to be more careful and economically strategic with what I say about myself, my ethic, progress and beliefs
      - Does the idea of SILO and sharing it with others (my _huge_ audience) out-value what I gain from showing off my own efforts and ideas toward self improvement?
        - What does the end result say about who I am 
          - Does this fit the narrative I wish to have on my personal website?
