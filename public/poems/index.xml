      <description>What Is The Subconscious  Who is it we hold  Down and beneath   What is it we share  Across one and each   A story that spans  Across cultures that repeat   What drives our passions  Through desires Buried in dreams   Turns over our fears And makes it all seem  As though it were simply All just me    Subconscious Group  The subconscious mind is like hanging out in a group  The majority of the time you will find yourself doing what they want On occasion, however, they may find themselves acting under your guidance:  Perhaps a favorite pastime Or an event you helmed It could happen after you have made a case,  Argued in support of a collective action Or it might just be a shine of that charisma you display,  Leading the others on       The squeaky wheel gets the oil  Just as such, the boastful peer steers the crew So when it comes time to decide what to do Speak your mind, and mind your voice Or who you become wont be your choice      Subconscious Gardener  Others may view the mind as they do a garden  The subconscious mind a rose bush, budding up from the soil  And the conscious mind an apt gardener  Unable to summon roses into place  But a skilled tailor   Quite proficient at revealing form and beauty  Which could easily be mistaken for conjured aesthetics   The astute gardener, however,  Is all too familiar with his limitations of shape  For he does not mold as a sculptor with clay But converses as a photographer with light The guiding of natural beauty with lens  The capture of what is through aperture       Nourishment and care, through intent over Time  This is how the gardener may confess what he finds          You Are What You Eat  You are what you eat  For you can only build from that which you have Tools, labor, composites and raw artifacts  Even the sweat off a brow   All humble in origins from foundation to finish With all the effort in man, one cannot build a brick house out of straw    </description>
