title: "SILO: The Why (Should)"
description: "Why does such a place exist where I outline a methodology with which to approach life and laud the successful application of said methods. Quite simply, because the world was not made perfect, nor is it becoming perfect; and taking straight to form we as individuals only have access to the concept of perfection in religious and in the aspirations of our efforts (which while trivial in the face of such an idea, they do not go barren of us."

I have decided that in addition to logging all of the situations in which I have employed SILO - successfully and not so successfully - that I should also create a place to note all the places that I _should_ use SILO. Of course, in my best interest and in the interest of proper use of SILO.

This is not to be confused with a TODO list. These are not places that I am planning or would like to apply SILO. In all actuality they are a testament to my own fear and self doubt. You see, no matter how much I grow and progress in my journey. Not matter how powerful a system SILO is and what it can do to transform my - or any - life, there will always be opportunity for arbitrage in life and any system that is not being profited off.

Bluntly, these are most likely areas I am afraid of applying SILO. Perhaps the image I maintain of myself will not allow for me to take on certain situations. The fear of change is real. If I am me now and I change after I do something, will I still be myself? That is, in essence, part of the attractive nature of this system, to truly and honestly actualize who it is you are and become who you are capable of when the appropriate amount of effort and skill is placed into looking out for your own self-interests.

I hope that in highlighting where I fail this system, that it will have the effect of emboldening you and any onlookers who see something interesting in the system. I want to get you off the sideline or hypotheticals and into the board room and a progressive life. One that progresses toward your best, happiest, and most fulfilled life - whatever you may find that to be.


I appreciate your time and am excited to find you at a place where you can consider the very real potential for reshaping of your life and the advancement of you as the individual which best represents you - in your personal place.
