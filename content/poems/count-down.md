The countdown, \
24 to 7. \
Start it again. \
The watch my clock. \
\
The week. time, \
It wont stop. \
No growth, hope, \
Or help for self. \

*A scroll through trending topics...* \
\
The square I seek \
but the top I seat. \
\
Aware of mindless tactics. \
Cost pride and dreams.. \

-meant I could \
save up, \
would trade \
\

\
Salvation, in \

my one, true, \
identity. \
Inevitably \
\
My mind bleeds \
-out, consciously, \
the mortality of \
my cognitive morality. \
\
If not for now, \
then for when \
its excuse proves \
that, for which, \
some -thing, -means \
i can use \
**... To Fall Down**
