## What Is The Subconscious

- Who is it we hold 
	- Down and beneath
- What is it we share
	- Across one and each
- A story that spans 
	- Across cultures that repeat
- What drives our passions
	- Through desires 
	- Buried in dreams
- Turns over our fears
- And makes it all seem
	- As though it were simply
	- All just me

## Subconscious Group

- The subconscious mind is like hanging out in a group
	- The majority of the time you will find yourself doing what they want
	- On occasion, however, they may find themselves acting under your guidance:
		- Perhaps a favorite pastime
		- Or an event you helmed
		- It could happen after you have made a case,
			- Argued in support of a collective action
			- Or it might just be a shine of that charisma you display, 
				- Leading the others on
	- The squeaky wheel gets the oil
		- Just as such, the boastful peer steers the crew
		- So when it comes time to decide what to do
		- Speak your mind, and mind your voice
		- Or who you become wont be your choice


## Subconscious Gardener

- Others may view the mind as they do a garden
	- The subconscious mind a rose bush, budding up from the soil
		- And the conscious mind an apt gardener
			- Unable to summon roses into place
				- But a skilled tailor
			- Quite proficient at revealing form and beauty
				- Which could easily be mistaken for conjured aesthetics
			- The astute gardener, however,
				- Is all too familiar with his limitations of shape
					- For he does not mold as a sculptor with clay
					- But converses as a photographer with light
					- The guiding of natural beauty with lens
						- The capture of what is through aperture
			- Nourishment and care, through intent over Time
				- This is how the gardener may confess what he finds


## You Are What You Eat

- You are what you eat
	- For you can only build from that which you have
	- Tools, labor, composites and raw artifacts
		- Even the sweat off a brow
	- All humble in origins from foundation to finish
	- With all the effort in man, one cannot build a brick house out of straw
