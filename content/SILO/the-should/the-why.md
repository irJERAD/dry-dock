I have decided that in addition to logging all of the situations in which I have employed SILO - successfully and not so successfully - that I should also create a place to note all the places that I _should_ use SILO. Of course, in my best interest and in the interest of proper use of SILO.

This is not to be confused with a TODO list. These are not places that I am planning or would like to apply SILO. In all actuality they are a testament to my own fear and self doubt. You see, no matter how much I grow and progress in my journey. Not matter how powerful a system SILO is and what it can do to transform my - or any - life.
