### The Problem with Instinct

I can't give you answers, \
that you already know. \
They'll send you in circles, \
Make you question the floor. \

To make progress on something \
you have already commenced, \
Is to break ground on the lawn \
which you already stand. \
\
I am no further ahead \
than you are behind. \
I sit where you stand \
and stand where you land. \
\
We lock eyes in crossing, \
heart pounding, face flush. \
Acknowledge, admire  and grin \
knowing such. \
\
What confidence brings \
validates as such. \
What knowing does not \
bring success free of lunch.
