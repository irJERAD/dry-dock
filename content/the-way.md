## The Where

Since I had come to accept three simple truths about the self, a journey had begun for me. The path of this journey branches out - into a pattern no doubt - like the fractal branches of a tree. What you find here is a digest, forming a symbolic route. A collection of nodes to an accessible passage. Here you might find it a more agreeable way to see and seek all within context. A conversation of realizations I hope find some value in.

## The What  

As long as I have reflected I have believed there lay within me somethings which remain unknown to myself. Discussing this with others I found this to be a common experience.
