# SILO  

Self Interest (based) Life Optimization

My preliminary thesis in exploring this idea is that there is an ideal way in which we can act selfishly and trust that in serving ourselves we are doing the greatest good - most directly to those in our closest circles (those whom we love and who love us - i.e. the ones that matter).

## Why is this of any importance?  
Strategy is much easier when the actor can assume they only need to act within their known - perhaps immediate, and maybe valuing more visceral.

If we can reduce the world in which we are living and making decisions in to a simpler model we will first notice a massive reduction in noise. Next we can better focus on the signal - whatever it is that we are interested in.

### For example:  
- You wish to purchase a car  
- The greatest reduction in noise comes when you decide to limit your search to a select few dealerships in your neighborhood  
- Now you are able to focus in on making a decision of very similar diversity, value proposition and expected return with exponentially less "noisy" input from others

## Why Self Interest?  
Simply put, it is easy when you just have to worry about yourself. Taking this concept and expanding on it to create a framework from which we can trust that in the successful pursuit of our own best interest we are intrinsically serving those we keep close (whom we love and love us).

This reduces overhead.

In the aforementioned situation you would ideally have some basic criteria for your planned vehicle purchase.
