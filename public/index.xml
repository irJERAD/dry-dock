      <description>TODO Problems TODO shows up in the top menu bar on the home page but not on pages further down the stream I have not gotten up new content folders I need my SILO folder and subfolders to produce blog like list pages with the individual post contained within each folder The pop up at the beginning of visiting the website is annoying Assess what your original goal / intention was behind it and consider: Can I just remove it quickly now for efficiency Do I need to find some place else to achieve the goal they set out to accomplish?</description>

      <title>SILO: The Why (Should)</title>

      <description>I have decided that in addition to logging all of the situations in which I have employed SILO - successfully and not so successfully - that I should also create a place to note all the places that I should use SILO.</description>

      <title>Subconscious Group Theory</title>

      <description>What Is The Subconscious Who is it we hold Down and beneath What is it we share Across one and each A story that spans Across cultures that repeat What drives our passions Through desires Buried in dreams Turns over our fears And makes it all seem As though it were simply All just me Subconscious Group The subconscious mind is like hanging out in a group The majority of the time you will find yourself doing what they want On occasion, however, they may find themselves acting under your guidance: Perhaps a favorite pastime Or an event you helmed It could happen after you have made a case, Argued in support of a collective action Or it might just be a shine of that charisma you display, Leading the others on The squeaky wheel gets the oil Just as such, the boastful peer steers the crew So when it comes time to decide what to do Speak your mind, and mind your voice Or who you become wont be your choice Subconscious Gardener Others may view the mind as they do a garden The subconscious mind a rose bush, budding up from the soil And the conscious mind an apt gardener Unable to summon roses into place But a skilled tailor Quite proficient at revealing form and beauty Which could easily be mistaken for conjured aesthetics The astute gardener, however, Is all too familiar with his limitations of shape For he does not mold as a sculptor with clay But converses as a photographer with light The guiding of natural beauty with lens The capture of what is through aperture Nourishment and care, through intent over Time This is how the gardener may confess what he finds You Are What You Eat You are what you eat For you can only build from that which you have Tools, labor, composites and raw artifacts Even the sweat off a brow All humble in origins from foundation to finish With all the effort in man, one cannot build a brick house out of straw </description>
